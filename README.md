# MomAmy Personalized Maternal Health

MomAmy Personalized Maternal Health is a Laravel 11 foundation for **MotherBridge ‚Äì Êô∫ÊÖßÂ≠ï‰∫ßÂÅ•Â∫∑Ê°£Ê°àÂπ≥Âè∞**, pairing clinical-grade infrastructure with a compassionate AI companion so every family can organize pregnancy records, observations, reports, and vitals with confidence while meeting enterprise requirements (Gravit-e, Optum).

The goal is to grow this service into a personalized maternal health assistant anchored by an AI avatar named **Mom Amy** who
can guide every user through their care journey with proactive recommendations.

## ‚ú® Key Modules

- **Pregnancy records** (`patients`, FHIR `Patient`): demographic profiles, pregnancy timeline, due date calculations.
- **Observations & vitals** (`observations`, `vitals`, FHIR `Observation`): weight, blood pressure, fetal heart rate, glucose trends.
- **Service requests** (`service_requests`, FHIR `ServiceRequest`): lab / ultrasound order history.
- **Diagnostic reports** (`reports`, FHIR `DiagnosticReport`): PDF/JPG/PNG uploads with metadata and secure download URLs.
- **Imaging studies** (`imaging_studies`, FHIR `ImagingStudy`): DICOM metadata placeholders ready for gRPC parsing.
- **Security & sharing**: Laravel Passport JWT, role-ready architecture, Couchbase session/document storage scaffolding.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Laravel 11 API with Passport for OAuth2 / JWT access tokens.
- MySQL handles transactional data; Couchbase reserved for document storage (FHIR JSON, session sharing).
- gRPC DICOM microservice stub (`grpc-dicom/`) prepared for image metadata parsing / de-identification.
- Job-ready scaffolding (queues, events) for OCR parsing, AI insights, BLE ingestion.
- API-first design so the future Vue 3 dashboard / mobile apps can connect consistently.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- MySQL 8+
- Couchbase Server 7+
- Node 18+ (for future Vue frontend)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url> mom-amy-care
cd mom-amy-care
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Set up database connections in `.env` (MySQL + Couchbase credentials). Then run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Passport client & storage setup:

```bash
php artisan passport:install
php artisan storage:link
```

Run the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Optional: start the gRPC DICOM stub (requires Go):

```bash
cd grpc-dicom
go run dicom_parser.go
```

## üîë API Highlights

- `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Äì create user + linked patient profile, returns Passport token.
- `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äì obtain JWT for authenticated calls.
- `GET /api/fhir/patients/{patient}` ‚Äì FHIR Patient resource view.
- `GET /api/fhir/patients/{patient}/observations` ‚Äì bundled Observation resources.
- `POST /api/patients/{patient}/vitals` ‚Äì store vitals & prep for FHIR mapping.
- `POST /api/patients/{patient}/reports` ‚Äì upload PDF/JPG/PNG diagnostic reports.

All secured routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Notes

- Docker Compose template (coming soon) will orchestrate Laravel, MySQL, Couchbase, gRPC service, and Nginx.
- For GKE / Cloud Run: move environment secrets to Secret Manager, enable Cloud SQL / Couchbase managed cluster.
- Frontend can be deployed separately (e.g., Vercel) consuming the REST endpoints.
- Log aggregation via Cloud Logging or ELK stack recommended for medical audits.

### Deploying to Vercel

Vercel can run the full Laravel + Vue experience by treating Laravel as a serverless PHP function and serving the compiled Vite
assets from `public/build`.

1. Commit and push this repository to GitHub (or another Git provider that Vercel supports).
2. In your Vercel dashboard, click **Add New‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Project** and import the repository.
3. On the project configuration screen set:
   - **Framework Preset**: `Other` (Laravel runs through the custom runtime).
   - **Root Directory**: leave blank so the project root is used.
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Install Command**: `composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev --optimize-autoloader && npm install`
   - **Output Directory**: `public`
4. Under **Environment Variables**, add your production values (at minimum `APP_KEY`, plus any database or API keys your build
   requires). Use `php artisan key:generate --show` locally to create a deployable `APP_KEY`.
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will install Composer + npm dependencies, run the Vite build, then provision the PHP serverless
   function defined in `api/index.php`.
6. After the first deployment finishes, open the live URL and you should see the Mom Amy onboarding dashboard.

#### Local smoke test for the Vercel build

You can mimic the production bundle before pushing by running:

```bash
composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm install
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and confirm the dashboard renders correctly. When you're done, run `composer install` (without
`--no-dev`) to restore your local development dependencies.

## üß≠ Roadmap Ideas

- BLE device ingestion (VitalMark reuse) streaming into `vitals` + Observation generation.
- OCR + AI summarization jobs producing pregnancy visit summaries (GPT Codex service).
- Temporary sharing tokens for physicians / doulas; integrate Keycloak or SAML SSO.
- FHIR bulk export + SMART-on-FHIR compatibility for enterprise partners.

Issues and PRs are welcome as the platform grows from family-use prototype to healthcare-grade solution.
